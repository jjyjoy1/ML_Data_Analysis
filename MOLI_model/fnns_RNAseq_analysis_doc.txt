Feed-Forward Neural Networks for RNA-seq Analysis
The code I've provided demonstrates how to build and train a feed-forward neural network (FNN) for analyzing gene expression data from RNA-seq experiments. This is commonly used for tasks like cancer classification based on gene expression patterns.
Computing Environment Requirements
To run this code, you'll need:

Python: Version 3.7 or higher
Libraries:

TensorFlow (2.x) - for building and training the neural network
NumPy - for numerical computations
Pandas - for data manipulation
Scikit-learn - for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
Matplotlib and Seaborn - for visualization



A typical setup command would be:
bashCopypip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
For larger datasets, GPU acceleration is recommended:
bashCopypip install tensorflow-gpu
Code Explanation
The provided code demonstrates a complete workflow for RNA-seq analysis:

Data Handling: It includes functions to either load real RNA-seq data from files or generate synthetic data for demonstration.
Preprocessing: The data is split into training and test sets, then standardized to ensure the neural network performs optimally.
Neural Network Architecture:

Input layer: Accepts gene expression values (one neuron per gene)
Hidden layers: Three dense layers with decreasing neurons (256→128→64)
Dropout layers: Added after each hidden layer to prevent overfitting
Output layer: Single neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification


Training Process: The model uses binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Evaluation: Displays accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
Feature Importance: Analyzes which genes contribute most to the classification decision.

This approach allows to identify which genes are most useful for distinguishing between conditions (like tumor vs. normal tissue), potentially revealing biomarkers or gene signatures associated with disease.
