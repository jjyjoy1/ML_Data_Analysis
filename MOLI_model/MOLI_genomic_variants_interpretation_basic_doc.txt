MOLI (Multi-Omics Late Integration)

Definition:
MOLI is a deep learning framework designed to integrate multi-omics data (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) using a late integration strategy. It processes each omics dataset independently through separate FNN branches, then combines high-level features for final predictions.

How It Works:

Per-Omics Processing: Each omics type (e.g., mutations, mRNA expression) is fed into a dedicated FNN to extract latent features.
Late Integration: Features from all FNN branches are concatenated and passed to a final FNN for joint prediction (e.g., cancer subtype, drug response).
Handling High-Dimensionality: Employs dropout or regularization to avoid overfitting on sparse omics data.
Advantages Over Other Integration Methods:

Early Integration: Combines raw data upfront, risking noise amplification.
Intermediate Integration: Aligns data mid-processing but may lose modality-specific patterns.
Late Integration (MOLI): Preserves unique patterns in each omics type before fusion, improving robustness.

Bioinformatics Applications:

Cancer Subtype Classification: Integrating somatic mutations, gene expression, and clinical data.
Drug Response Prediction: Linking multi-omics profiles to therapeutic outcomes.
Biomarker Discovery: Identifying cross-omics signatures for diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s.
Personalized Medicine: Tailoring treatments based on patient-specific omics data.
