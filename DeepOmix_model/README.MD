# Complete DeepOmix RNA-seq Analysis Workflow

This workflow demonstrates how to implement and use the DeepOmix model for analyzing RNA-seq data with survival information. DeepOmix is a knowledge-structured deep learning model that incorporates pathway information to improve interpretability and performance in survival prediction tasks.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of three main components:

1. **Pathway Data Preparation** - Converting gene-level data to pathway-level information using biological databases
2. **Data Processing for DeepOmix** - Setting up and organizing the data for model training
3. **DeepOmix Model Training and Analysis** - Building, training, and analyzing the model

## Step 1: Prepare Pathway Data

First, you'll need to prepare pathway data from biological knowledge databases like KEGG, GO, or Reactome. Use the `PathwayDataPreprocessor` class from the first artifact:

```python
# Import the preprocessor
from pathway_data_preparation import PathwayDataPreprocessor

# Initialize the preprocessor for human data
preprocessor = PathwayDataPreprocessor(species="human", data_dir="pathway_data")

# Download pathway data (choose one method)
kegg_pathways = preprocessor.download_kegg_pathways()
# or:
# reactome_pathways = preprocessor.download_reactome_pathways()
# or:
# go_terms = preprocessor.download_go_terms(go_aspects=["BP"])

# Filter pathways based on size
filtered_pathways = preprocessor.filter_pathway_data(
    kegg_pathways, min_genes=5, max_genes=200
)

# Write to format needed by DeepOmix
preprocessor.write_pathway_data_for_deepomix(
    filtered_pathways, "kegg_pathways_for_deepomix.txt"
)
```

## Step 2: Set Up and Process Your Data

Next, organize your RNA-seq data and survival information:

```python
# Import the necessary modules
from pathway_data_usage import prepare_data_for_deepomix, analyze_pathway_coverage

# Prepare the data (this function handles loading RNA-seq and survival data)
data = prepare_data_for_deepomix()

# Analyze pathway coverage to check how well your genes are represented in pathways
coverage_stats = analyze_pathway_coverage(data['rna_seq_data'], data['pathway_genes'])
visualize_pathway_coverage(coverage_stats)

# Prepare the data for DeepOmix training
data_dict = prepare_for_training_deepomix(
    data['rna_seq_data'], 
    data['survival_data'], 
    data['pathway_genes']
)
```

## Step 3: Run the Full DeepOmix Analysis

Finally, use the complete DeepOmix implementation to train and analyze the model:

```python
# Import the main analysis module
from complete_deepomix_example import run_deepomix_analysis

# Run the full analysis
results = run_deepomix_analysis(
    "data/rna_seq_data.csv",       # Path to RNA-seq data file
    "data/survival_data.csv",      # Path to survival data file
    "kegg_pathways_for_deepomix.txt",  # Path to pathway data file
    batch_size=32,                 # Batch size for training
    learning_rate=0.001,           # Learning rate
    num_epochs=100,                # Number of training epochs
    patience=10,                   # Early stopping patience
    hidden_dims=[64, 32],          # Hidden layer dimensions
    dropout_rate=0.3               # Dropout rate for regularization
)

# The results dictionary contains:
# - The trained model
# - Training history
# - Evaluation metrics (c-index, etc.)
# - Pathway importance analysis
# - Differential pathway analysis
# - Visualizations (saved as PNG files)
```

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Biological Interpretability**: By incorporating pathway information, DeepOmix provides biologically meaningful results that can be interpreted in the context of known biological processes.
- **Improved Survival Prediction**: The model leverages pathway knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy for patient outcomes.
- **Pathway Importance Analysis**: Identifies which biological pathways are most important for predicting survival.
- **Differential Pathway Analysis**: Uncovers differences in pathway activation between high-risk and low-risk patients.
- **Visualizations**: Automatically generates various plots to help interpret the results, including:
  - Kaplan-Meier survival curves
  - Pathway importance rankings
  - Differentially activated pathways
  - Pathway activation heatmaps

## Resource Requirements

- **Memory**: The amount needed depends on your dataset size. For typical cancer datasets (10,000-20,000 genes, hundreds of samples), at least 8GB RAM is recommended.
- **Storage**: Several GB may be needed for storing downloaded pathway databases.
- **Computation**: A CPU is sufficient for smaller datasets, but a GPU will significantly speed up training for larger datasets.
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.6+, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Lifelines, SciPy, and various bioinformatics packages.

This workflow provides a comprehensive framework for applying DeepOmix to RNA-seq data and extracting meaningful biological insights related to patient survival.
