**Looking into DeepOmix model**


**Exploring DeepOmix and other models**

This ia a summary of the DeepOmix machine learning model, particularly its use in bioinformatics. I also need to identify other models that incorporate domain knowledge into their architecture. 
DeepOmix: Deep Learning-based Integration of Multi-Omics Data for Disease Prediction. 
Other models integrating domain expertise might include MoGCN and GraphOmics. I gathered more information on these and check out their usage, performance, and clinical relevance to provide a complete answer.


**Exploring domain-specific models**

Those models use biological networks, like MoGCN, scGNN, and DRUGGNN. Also, Pathway-guided models such as Pathway-based Autoencoders (PAE) and PASNet seem relevant. There are models like iGEM, P-NET, DeepGraphGO, MPNNs, and NEPath. Models leveraging knowledge graphs, including Deep Patient and GraphRNet, also come up. I try to find more on their usage, performance, and clinical cases, so I dig deeper into them and gather the necessary citations.

**Exploring more domain-specific models**

The graph neural networks like MoGCN, scGNN, and DRUGGNN, which utilize biological networks. 
Pathway-guided models like Pathway-based Autoencoders (PAE) and PASNet are also relevant. These models contain such as iGEM, P-NET, DeepGraphGO, MPNNs, and NEPath. 
Knowledge graph models, including Deep Patient and GraphRNet, could be part of the discussion too. 
Additionally, models like BIONN, DeepGO, and GraphReg seem to incorporate domain knowledge effectively. I try to search for more details on these models and their applications.


\### DeepOmix ‑ key ideas & results

| Aspect                 | Summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose                | End‑to‑end framework that **maps multi‑omics features to clinical‑survival outcomes** while remaining biologically interpretable.                                                                                                                                             |
| Architecture           | Five layers: **Gene layer → user‑defined functional‑module layer (pathways, tissue networks, etc.) → two hidden layers → Cox‑output layer**. Edges between the first two layers are *hard‑masked* by prior knowledge, forcing each gene to talk only to its annotated module. |
| Training & scalability | Implements weight‑sharing + dropout so it scales to pan‑cancer datasets; coded in PyTorch.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Performance            | Across eight TCGA cancers DeepOmix lifted the **C‑index by ≈0.04‑0.12** over five contemporary integrators; for Lower‑Grade Glioma it separated high vs. low‑risk patients (log‑rank P < 0.001) and highlighted driver pathways such as PI3K‑Akt‑mTOR. ([PubMed][1])          |
| Clinical take‑away     | Because the functional‑module layer is visible, clinicians can trace survival risk back to pathways and genes, streamlining biomarker discovery and experimental follow‑up.                                                                                                   |

\### Why these designs matter

1. **Better generalisation with fewer parameters** – masking extraneous edges means the model sees far less noise and overfits less (cf. P‑NET’s 71 k vs 270 M weights).
2. **Interpretability you can *act on*** – weights can be aggregated back to pathways, ontologies or graph modules, giving biologists concrete hypotheses.
3. **Data‑efficient learning** – visible layers act as strong regularisers, so models train on hundreds rather than tens‑of‑thousands of samples.
4. **Clinical translation** – several models have already informed biomarker panels (MDM4, HER2‑CNV, pathway scores) or therapy choice (DrugCell‑guided combos).

\### Using / extending these models in practice

| Step                | Advice                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data prep           | Standardise IDs across omics layers (HGNC symbols, Ensembl IDs) and map to the same pathway/ontology version used by the model; impute missing values conservatively (e.g., zero‑imputation with a “missing” indicator). |
| Frameworks          | Most published code bases are in **PyTorch** (P‑NET, MoGCN, DrugCell) or **TensorFlow** (PASNet); fine‑tune on your cohort with modest GPUs (≤16 GB VRAM) thanks to sparse connectivity.                                 |
| Custom knowledge    | All of these architectures accept user‑supplied GMT or OBO files – you can plug in **tissue‑specific pathways, eQTL networks, or curated GRNs** to focus learning on your domain.                                        |
| Validation          | Combine conventional metrics (C‑index, AUROC) with **model‑based explanations** (SHAP on visible units, attention weights in GCN) and external data (CRISPR screens, TCGA survival) for biological credibility.          |
| Clinical deployment | Freeze the visible layers (to keep interpretability), export as ONNX, and wrap with a pipeline that performs QC → normalisation → model inference → pathway report PDF for tumour board review.                          |

**Bottom line:** DeepOmix exemplifies a growing family of *knowledge‑guided* deep‑learning models that deliver state‑of‑the‑art accuracy **and** transparent biological insight. By wiring canonical pathways, ontologies or patient graphs directly into their architecture, these models bridge the gap between black‑box AI and mechanism‑driven precision medicine.
