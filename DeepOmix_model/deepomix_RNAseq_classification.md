DeepOmix extends the idea of MiNet by incorporating hierarchical biological organization (e.g., genes → pathways → higher-order modules). It allows multi-level abstraction, mimicking how genes collectively influence phenotypes.

Architecture:

Input Layer: Gene-level data.
Hidden Layers:
Gene-to-Pathway Layer: Connections defined by pathway databases.
Pathway-to-Module Layer: Aggregates pathways into functional modules (e.g., immune response, metabolism).
Output Layer: Predicts outcomes like disease status or treatment response.
Key Features:

Hierarchical Structure: Captures complex interactions (e.g., cross-talk between pathways).
Flexibility: Can integrate multi-omics data (e.g., genomics + proteomics).
Applications:

Biomarker discovery, multi-omics integration, mechanistic hypothesis generation.
Advantages:

Balances biological fidelity with deep learning power.
Uncovers higher-order interactions missed by flat models.

DeepOmix Implementation
The code I've provided demonstrates how a DeepOmix-style model works for cancer subtype classification using multi-omics data. Let me explain the key components that make this implementation reflect the DeepOmix philosophy:
1. Biological Knowledge Integration
The model incorporates three levels of biological hierarchy:

Molecular level: Gene expression and methylation data (raw omics data)
Pathway level: Genes and methylation sites are mapped to biological pathways
Process level: Pathways are grouped into higher-level biological processes

This hierarchical structure mirrors actual biological organization and is a defining feature of DeepOmix.


2. Constrained Network Architecture
Unlike standard neural networks, DeepOmix uses prior knowledge to constrain connections:
Convert biological knowledge matrices to PyTorch tensors
'''
self.gene_pathway_connections = nn.Parameter(
    torch.FloatTensor(gene_pathway_matrix), 
    requires_grad=False  # Fixed connections based on prior knowledge
)
'''
These fixed connections ensure that genes only connect to their relevant pathways, making the model biologically meaningful.
3. Attention Mechanisms
DeepOmix uses attention to allow different biological components to have varying importance:
Apply pathway attention
'''
pathway_attended, self.pathway_attention_weights = self.pathway_attention(pathway_combined)
'''
This allows the model to focus on the most relevant pathways for a particular prediction, similar to how biological systems work.

4. Multi-omics Integration
The model integrates multiple data types at the pathway level:
Project to pathway space (applying biological constraints)
'''
pathway_from_genes = self.pathway_transform_gene(gene_encoded)
pathway_from_methyl = self.pathway_transform_methyl(methyl_encoded)
'''
Combine pathway signals from different omics
'''
pathway_combined = pathway_from_genes + pathway_from_methyl
'''
This integration happens in a biologically meaningful way - through shared pathways.

5. Interpretability Features
The model stores activations and attention weights for interpretation:
'''
def interpret_model(model, test_loader):
    """Extract and visualize biological insights from the trained model."""
    # ...
    pathway_importance = pathway_attention.mean(axis=0)  
    # ...
'''

This allows researchers to extract biological insights about which pathways and processes are most important for classification.
