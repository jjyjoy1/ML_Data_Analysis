Preparing pathway databases for use in models like DeepOmix involves mapping your gene expression data to biological pathways (e.g., KEGG, Reactome, Gene Ontology) and structuring these relationships into a format compatible with your model (e.g., a gene-pathway membership matrix). Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Choose Pathway Databases

Select databases that align with your organism and research question. Common options:

KEGG Pathways: Curated metabolic/signaling pathways (e.g., hsa00010 for human glycolysis).
Reactome: Detailed human biological processes.
Gene Ontology (GO): Broad functional terms (e.g., "immune response").
MSigDB: Collections like Hallmark gene sets or curated pathways.
WikiPathways: Community-curated pathways.

Tools to Access Pathways:

gseapy (Python): Fetch pathways from MSigDB, KEGG, Reactome, etc.
BioMart/Ensembl: Convert gene IDs to pathway annotations.
clusterProfiler (R): Pathway enrichment and ID mapping.

Step 2: Map Gene Identifiers

Pathway databases use specific gene identifiers (e.g., Entrez, Ensembl, HGNC symbols). Ensure your expression data’s gene IDs match the pathway database’s format.

Example Workflow:

Input: Normalized expression matrix with gene symbols (e.g., TP53, EGFR).
Convert IDs:
Use tools like MyGene.info (Python) or org.Hs.eg.db (R) to map gene symbols to Entrez/Ensembl IDs.
Example Python code using mygene:
'''
import mygene

mg = mygene.MyGeneInfo()
gene_symbols = ['TP53', 'EGFR', 'BRCA1']
result = mg.querymany(gene_symbols, scopes='symbol', fields='entrezgene', species='human')
# Output: Map symbols to Entrez IDs (e.g., TP53 → 7157)
'''

Step 3: Build a Gene-Pathway Membership Matrix
Create a binary matrix where rows = genes, columns = pathways, and 1 indicates a gene belongs to a pathway.

Example Code Using gseapy:
'''
import gseapy as gp
import pandas as pd

# Fetch KEGG pathways for human
pathway_db = 'KEGG_2021_Human'
pathways = gp.get_library(name=pathway_db)
# Create a gene-pathway matrix
genes = [...]  # List of your gene IDs (e.g., Entrez)
pathway_mask = pd.DataFrame(0, index=genes, columns=pathways.keys())

for pathway, gene_list in pathways.items():
    pathway_mask.loc[pathway_mask.index.isin(gene_list), pathway] = 1

# Save as a CSV or use directly in DeepOmix
pathway_mask.to_csv('gene_pathway_matrix.csv')
'''

Step 4: Validate Coverage
Ensure your expression data’s genes are sufficiently covered by the pathways. For example:
'''
coverage = pathway_mask.sum(axis=1)  # Number of pathways each gene belongs to
print(f"Genes not in any pathway: {len(coverage[coverage == 0])}")
print(f"Median pathways per gene: {coverage.median()}")
'''

Solutions for Poor Coverage:

Combine multiple databases (e.g., KEGG + Reactome + GO).
Use hierarchical pathways (e.g., GO terms with parent-child relationships).
Filter out genes not in any pathway (if necessary).

Step 5: Integrate with DeepOmix
Load the gene-pathway matrix as a mask to constrain connections in the model’s first layer (as shown in the earlier code example).
'''
import torch
# Load the gene-pathway matrix
pathway_mask_df = pd.read_csv('gene_pathway_matrix.csv', index_col=0)
pathway_mask_tensor = torch.tensor(pathway_mask_df.values, dtype=torch.float32)

# Initialize DeepOmix with the mask
model = DeepOmix(
    n_genes=pathway_mask_df.shape[0],
    n_pathways=pathway_mask_df.shape[1],
    pathway_mask=pathway_mask_tensor
)
'''
