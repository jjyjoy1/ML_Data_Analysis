This repo initial used ruppinlab published paper, and released code, and then extend to extra more ML models. 
And convert to all code to python code, and change R ExperimentSet object to python Anndata object

1. Define the Problem and Goals

    Outcome Definition:
    Clearly specify what “cancer status” means in your context (e.g., cancer vs. non-cancer, tumor grade, survival outcome, etc.). This will determine whether your problem is framed as a classification or regression task.

    Scope:
    Decide if you will build separate models for each data type (clinical, transcriptomic, microbiome) and/or develop an integrated (multi-modal) model that combines all three sources.

    Performance Metrics:
    Identify relevant metrics (accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision/recall, etc.) to evaluate model performance, keeping in mind class imbalances and clinical relevance.

2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
A. Clinical Metadata

    Missing Data:
    Handle any missing values (imputation or removal) for variables like age, gender, tumor status.
    Categorical Encoding:
    Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, tumor status) using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
    Normalization/Scaling:
    Standardize numerical variables if needed (e.g., age).

B. RNA Sequence Data (Expression Table)

    Normalization:
    RNA-seq data often require normalization (e.g., TPM, FPKM, or methods like DESeq2’s variance-stabilizing transformation) to correct for library size and other technical effects.
    Filtering:
    Remove lowly expressed genes to reduce noise and dimensionality.
    Log-Transformation:
    Consider log-transforming the data if expression distributions are skewed.

C. Metagenomics Taxonomy Data

    Normalization:
    Normalize counts to relative abundances (or use methods like centered log-ratio transformation) to account for compositionality.
    Dimensionality Reduction:
    The taxonomy table might be high-dimensional; consider filtering out very rare taxa or using clustering to summarize related features.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Univariate Analysis:
    Visualize distributions of individual features from each data source.
    Correlation Analysis:
    Identify relationships among clinical variables, and between clinical and omics features.
    Data Integration Visualization:
    Use techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP on the high-dimensional RNA and taxonomy data to understand sample clustering and variance structure.

4. Feature Engineering and Selection

    Clinical Data:
    You might create composite variables (e.g., age groups) if they better capture risk.

    Omics Data (RNA and Metagenomics):
        Feature Selection:
        Use statistical tests (e.g., differential expression analysis, univariate tests for microbiome features) to shortlist relevant features.
        Dimensionality Reduction:
        Techniques such as PCA, autoencoders, or even regularization methods (LASSO) can help reduce feature dimensionality before model training.
        Biological Context:
        Leverage known pathways or taxonomic hierarchies to aggregate features if that makes biological sense.

    Data Integration Strategies:
        Early Integration (Feature-Level Fusion):
        Concatenate normalized features from all sources into a single feature vector for each patient.
        Intermediate/Late Integration (Model-Level Fusion):
        Train separate models on each data type and combine predictions (e.g., via ensemble learning or meta-modeling).

5. Model Selection and Development
A. Choose Algorithms

    Classical ML Algorithms:
    Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) are robust and can handle heterogeneous data.
    Regularized Logistic Regression:
    Good for binary classification with high-dimensional data (with LASSO or Ridge).
    Neural Networks:
    Deep learning models (e.g., multi-layer perceptrons) can capture complex nonlinear relationships, particularly useful if you have a large sample size and many features.
    Multi-modal Architectures:
    If you decide to integrate data modalities in a deep learning framework, consider architectures that have separate branches for each data type that are then merged.
    I added more deep learning model for robust data analysis, e.g VAEs, MOLI, DeepOmix and MoGN models, and also attached the detai
ls document for each model usage.

B. Model Training

    Data Splitting:
    Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Consider stratified splits if class distributions are imbalanced.
    Cross-Validation:
    Use k-fold cross-validation to robustly estimate model performance and avoid overfitting.

C. Hyperparameter Tuning

    Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization techniques to optimize your model parameters.

6. Model Evaluation and Interpretation

    Performance Metrics:
    Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., AUC, accuracy, sensitivity/specificity). For imbalanced classes, metrics like F1-score and AUC-ROC can be more informative.
    Interpretability:
        Use feature importance scores (e.g., from Random Forests) or SHAP/LIME for model interpretability.
        For omics data, biological interpretability (e.g., gene/pathway enrichment analysis) is often as important as predictive performance.

7. Validation and External Testing

    Internal Validation:
    After model tuning, validate performance on a held-out test set.
    External Validation:
    If possible, test your model on an independent dataset to assess its generalizability.
    Clinical Relevance:
    Ensure that the model’s predictions make sense clinically and statistically, and consider consultation with domain experts.

8. Iterative Refinement and Deployment

    Model Refinement:
    Iterate over feature selection, algorithm tuning, and integration strategies based on performance and feedback.
    Deployment Considerations:
    Think about how the model would be implemented in a clinical setting: ease of data collection, processing time, and interpretability are key factors.
    Documentation and Reproducibility:
    Document your analysis pipeline using tools like Jupyter notebooks, version control (Git), and workflow management systems (e.g., Snakemake or Nextflow).

Summary

    Define the problem clearly (what is “cancer status” and what are your performance goals).
    Preprocess each dataset individually (clinical, RNA-seq, metagenomics), handling normalization, missing values, and dimensionality issues.
    Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand your data and guide feature engineering.
    Select and engineer features (and consider both early and late data integration strategies).
    Choose and train machine learning models using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
    Evaluate and interpret model performance, considering both statistical and biological/clinical insights.
    Iterate and validate using external datasets if available, preparing your model for potential clinical use.
